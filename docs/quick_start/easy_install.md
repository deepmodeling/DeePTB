# Installation

This guide helps you install DeePTB with basic features. We recommend building DeePTB using **virtual environment** to avoid dependency issues by

```python
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
``` 
See more details for virtual environment [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

## From Source
If you are installing from source, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or later
- torch 1.13.0 or later, following the instruction on [PyTorch: Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) if GPU support is required, otherwise this can be installed with the building procedure.
- ifermi (optional, install only when 3D fermi-surface plotting is needed.)

First clone or download the source code from the website.
Then, located in the repository root and running 

```bash
cd path/deeptb
pip install .
```
## From Pypi and Conda

Will be available soon.
