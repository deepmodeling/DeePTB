## About DeePTB

**DeePTB** is an innovative Python package that employs deep learning to construct electronic Hamiltonians using a minimal basis Slater-Koster TB(**SKTB**), and full LCAO basis using E3-equivariant neural networks (**E3TB**). It is designed to:

- Efficiently predict TB/LCAO Hamiltonians for large, unseen structures based on training with smaller ones.
- Enable simulations of large systems under structural perturbations, finite temperature simulations integrating molecular dynamics (MD) for comprehensive atomic and electronic behavior.

For **SKTB**:
- Support customizable Slater-Koster parameterization with neural network incorporation for local environmental corrections. 
- Operate independently of the choice of bases and exchange-correlation functionals, offering flexibility and adaptability.
- Handle systems with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects.

For **E3TB**:
- Support constructing DFT Hamiltonians/density and overlap matrices under full LCAO basis.
- Utilize strictly local and semi-local E3-equivariant neural networks to achieve high data-efficiency and accuracy.
- Speed up via SO(2)convolution to support LCAO basis containing f and g orbitals.

**DeePTB** is a versatile tool adaptable for a wide range of materials and phenomena, providing accurate and efficient simulations. See more details in our DeePTB paper: [sktb: arXiv:2307.04638](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04638), [e3tb: arXiv:2407.06053](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06053)
