Accelerate Performance
=================================================

This section describes various methods for improving ABACUS performance for different classes of problems running on different kinds of devices.

Accelerated versions of CUDA GPU implementations have been added to ABACUS, which will typically run faster than the standard non-accelerated versions. This requires appropriate hardware to be present on your system, e.g. NVIDIA GPUs.
